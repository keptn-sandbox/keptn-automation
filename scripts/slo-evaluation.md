# Overview

Use this action type to perform a [SLO evaluation](https://keptn.sh/docs/0.8.x/quality_gates/get_started/)

##Use Cases:**
* Add this following a performance test to automate results analysis
* Add this to code pipeline as a `quality gate` prior to deploying to another environment
* Add this to following the performance test of individual services as a prerequisite quality gate to integrated tests
* Add this following a deployment based on real-user traffic to ensure it was successful

## Script logic

1. call `keptn auth`
1. For the provided Keptn project, service, and stage, call `keptn trigger evaluation` event and save the `Keptn Context ID` returned from the response
1. Loop and call the Keptn API every 10 seconds using the `Keptn Context ID` to retrieve results
    * If there is no response with the number loops set by the `WAIT_LOOPS`, then exit with status 1
1. If there is a response from Keptn, then Docker will exit with status of 1 or 0 based on the logic behind the passed in `process_type` argument:
    * If the Keptn status = `ignore`, then always return zero
    * If the Keptn status = `pass_on_warning`, then - return zero unless keptn status equals fail
    * If the Keptn status = `fail_on_warning`, then - return zero unless keptn status equals fail or warn
